# What is Statistics and Its Role in Cybersecurity

**What is Statistics?**  
Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to uncover patterns, summarize information, and make evidence-based decisions. It includes methods for describing data, drawing conclusions from samples, and predicting future trends.

**Statistics in Cybersecurity**  
In cybersecurity, statistics helps professionals detect unusual patterns, identify potential threats, and evaluate the effectiveness of security measures. By applying statistical analysis, organizations can:

- Monitor network traffic and user behavior for anomalies  
- Detect and respond to security breaches early  
- Assess and improve security protocols  
- Predict and prevent future cyber attacks  

Using statistics, cybersecurity experts can make **data-driven decisions** that strengthen defenses and reduce risk.
